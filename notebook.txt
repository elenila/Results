Today we have choose to work with GitHub for sharing our files.
We have also created our directory organization with help of the Stafford Nobles article:
http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424
We choose to have a top level directory named Project and within that directoty we created five subdirectories 
(doc, data, src, bin and Results). We also choose to use Nobles idea with dates because we thought it was a good way to connect
the different parts that we are going to write. For example we can go to our notebook and see that the day (2015-12-15) we
wrote a script and we can then in Results we can find two files with that date (2015-12-15) in their name: One is containing
the code and the other one has the results from a test run of the code.
We also copied the data from /info/appbio12/data/noise_project to our data directory. We did that with the comandline 'cp -r * /home/n/u1tw68bn/appbio15/Project/data'.

To next time we are going to start programming and therfore we are going to read more about the project to get a deeper 
understanding about it.

Today we worked futher with understanding the project and what it's saying before creating our program. 
2 files have been created: code2015-12-18.py    res2015-12-18.txt
The code-file there should be code with description but 
today it is more description on what the code could contain.
The res-file is the result of what the code gives, tells us, 
if it has errors what does it depends on and questions. 
Today it the file contain for the most questions for next time.

I have created the same directory structur on my KTH login as we have on Viktors KTH login. I have also copied the data
from /info/appbio12/data/noise_project as we did 2015-12-15. The plan was to start programming today but I got stuck because I
did not understand the assigment due to the language. 

To the next time I gonna get help to understand the egnlish so I can start with the code.
